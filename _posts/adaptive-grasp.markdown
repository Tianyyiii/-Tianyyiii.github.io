A novel grasping
point optimization scheme that leverages gradient information
from the differentiable simulation process. We Conducted extensive experiments of clothes
grasping tasks on manipulating hats, socks and bags and
our gradient-based optimization scheme successfully optimizes
grasp points to achieve optimal results.
